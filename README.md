MLEnd Yummy Dataset


The Yummy dataset is a curated collection of food images, which includes a diverse range of dishes.

The dataset not only contains the images but also comes with an accompanying metadata file, which enriches the dataset with additional information.

Key categories included in the metadata are:

- **Index**: A unique identifier for each entry.
- **Dish Name**: The name of the dish featured in the image.
- **Home / Restaurant**: A classification that indicates whether the dish was prepared at home or sourced from a restaurant.
- **Cuisine**: The type of cuisine the dish belongs to.
- **Ingredients**: The main ingredients used in the preparation of the dish.
- **Diet**: Dietary classification, which could include labels such as vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.
- **Healthiness Rating**: A subjective rating of how healthy the dish is perceived to be.
- **How Much Did You Like It?**: A personal rating reflecting the individual’s enjoyment of the dish.

Each of these categories serves to provide multiple angles of analysis. For instance, one could study the correlation between perceived healthiness and enjoyment, or the accuracy of classifying a dish’s preparation origin based on its visual characteristics. For those interested in exploring the dataset further, details and additional resources can be found in the "Yummy" repository.
